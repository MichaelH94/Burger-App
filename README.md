# Burger-App
Assignment for KU Coding Bootcamp

Eat-Da-Burger!

Eat-Da-Burger! is a simple database and DOM manipulation application that utilizes Node, Express and Handlebars to manipulate a MySQL database and a webpage styled through Bootstrap.

The premise is simple: click the green burgers to "eat" them! They're not removed from the database, simply marked as devoured and moved to the other column. Below both colums is a form to enter a new burger for you to eat. Simple, but demonstrates the power of Express and Handlebars.
